# EKH Code Reviews

## What is a code review
Code Reviews can help improve code and coding skills.
Just like a paper can be better understood by discussing it in a group, code too can be improved by doing so.

## How Does a Code Review Work

Using github to review pull requests.
## Schedule

The idea is to have a reoccurring meeting to review code.
