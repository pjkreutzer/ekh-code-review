## What Is a Code Review?
Code Reviews can help improve code and coding skills.
Just like a paper can be better understood by discussing it in a group, code too can be improved by doing so.

The idea for doing code reviews comes from [the Good Research Code Handbook](https://goodresearch.dev/social.html).
The handbook is overall an excellent source of inspiration to learn form best practices in software engineering.

## How Does a Code Review Work?

During each code review meeting we will talk about improvements which can be made to real life code written by people at the department.
Each meeting is structured around one person's code.
The code file is circulated in advance, giving everyone interested in joining the meeting the chance to review, comment and improve on the written code.
During the meeting the most helpful comments, chosen by the original code author, will be presented and discussed.

## Schedule

The idea is to have a reoccurring meeting to review code.
