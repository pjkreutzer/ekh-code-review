# Presenting Code

If you want your code to be reviewed then please create a pull request for your code on github.
To keep the review manageable, please limit the code you want to have reviewed to 400 lines or less.
This does not mean that the files you upload should only be 400 lines long -- context is important -- but please indicate which lines to focus on.
To provide context to your code, please fill in the README template found [here]() and include it in the upload folder.
The README helps you explain

* where this code fits in the overall context of your project,

* what code chunks you want to focus the review on,

* specific questions you might have.

## What Code Can I Send for Review?

You can send in any code for review.
It does not matter if the project is finished or if the code belongs to a project you are currently working on.

Do not worry about your code not being finished or perhaps not good enough.
The entire point of this is to learn from each other and improve our skills.
At the same time, don't worry about your code being too complicated.
Other than in software engineering, your code will not be exclusively reviewed by someone more qualified than you.
Prepare for the possibility that people will review your code who have (much) less experience than you.
See this as an opportunity to flex your skills and improve your understanding by explaining how it works to others.

Similarly, keep in mind that the focus of the code review is on the software, not the project for which the software is written.
Unlike a research seminar, the theory, data quality etc are not the focus.
You do not have to defend why you chose one estimation strategy over another, these reviews are all about the software implementation.
Simply provide as much information about your research as needed for context.

### Important

Whatever you push to github will be available for the public and permanently become part of the repos history.
Be sure that you do not expose sensitive information in the code such as credentials or GDPR protected data.

In general, unless there is a really good reason, do not include your data in the submission.
Code can and should be reviewed without needing your data. 
## How do I present my Code?

1. Pull the example repo.
    You can do this in different ways, the easiest is by running this code in your command line:

    ```
    
    ```

Add the code you want reviewed and fill in the README
